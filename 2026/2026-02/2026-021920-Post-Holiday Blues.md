# Post-Holiday Blues

Are you feeling sad about getting back to work or school?

Most people await holidays with bated breath, eager for a break and a chance to have fun and reconnect with family. But when the holiday ends, many people can be far from satisfied. Instead, they feel sad or disappointed and struggle to find the motivation to return to work or school. This common experience, called the post-holiday blues, can be frustrating and discouraging, especially  for those who expected to feel refreshed after their time off.

Why might you be feeling worse after your break than you did before?Sometimes vocations are surprisingly stressful or require more energy than one might predict. Some people love looking forward to vocations, and so getting back and not having another one to anticipate for a long time can be disappointing. And sometimes, people simply struggle to transition from one schedule to another.

So what do you do if you're feeling sad after a vocation? Start returning to healthy routines: sleeping at regular hours, eating healthy meals at your usual times and so on. Exercise not only qualifies as a healthy routine but also stimulates your body to release chemicals that make you feel good.

Planning a new vocation or another fun activity can also help cheer you up. And so can intentionally making time for things you enjoy.

Sometimes people feel guilty for struggling after returning from vocation, but that is neither necessary nor helpful. Don't compare yourself to others or beat yourself up if you feel despondent about returning to work or school after a break. And don't expect to function at your normal productivity level when you first get back. Instead, upon returning to work, start with some less intense assignments to give your mind and body time to adjust.

Many people think of work and rest as opposing goals, but in fact, they complement each other. Rest energizes you for work, and you work in part so that you have money for other things you find fulfilling.

The post-holiday blues usually pass relatively quickly, so if you still feel sad after two weeks, something else may be going on. You might be experiencing depression, in which case a doctor or therapist may be able to help. Or you might need to consider a career change. If going back to work after a vocation leads to a prolonged period of sadness, then the job itself may be too stressful or not fulfilling enough for you.

Returning from vocation can make you feel blue, but it's also a chance to carry that sense of wonder into everyday life. By turning your travel memories into daily inspiration, you can keep that vocation spirit alive ling after you've unpacked your bags.
