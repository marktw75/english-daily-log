# Chloe Kim - The Queen of Snowboarding

One of the most competitive female snowboarders of all time

Many California girls live for the beach, but from a very young age, Chloe Kim's preference went in a different direction - to snow.

She was born in Long Beach, California, in 2000 to South Korean parents. When Chloe turned 4, her parents introduced her to snowboarding. The child snowed athletic ability and talent for the sport, leading to competition at the age of 6.

Though her parents supported her, they advised that Chloe focus on her education. So she spent her third-fourth-grade years in school in Switzerland studying French.

Upon Chloe's return to California, every weekend her dad began driving her nearly six hours away to a popular ski resort where she began snowboarding again.

The training paid off! Chloe won a gold medal at the 2015 X Games, making her the youngest to ever achieve that status. That led to another triumph and another gold at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeong Chang, South Korea. There, she made a name for herself on the halfpipe, achieving a nearly perfect score of 100. This win was especially meaningful for the young athlete because her extended South Korean family was there to support her as she competed.

As everyone had expected, the talented competitor brought home the gold medal from the 2018 Olympic Games. But those demanding expectations, along with the anxiety of competition, were beginning to take their roll, and Chloe considered leaving competition behind. She began working with a therapist, who helped her discover her value as a person and not just as an athlete.

After that, she switched up her training routine, practicing some old moves and opting only for those that were exciting and challenging. Chloe felt it was essential that she be inspired once again and remember why she had "wanted to do this sport in the beginning."

As she prepared for the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics, she acknowledged that she stood to break a record in the halfpipe. But win or lose, Chloe decided ahead of time that she was determined not to let the stress dominate her or a loss define her.

"I think true success is being content with where you are and who you are. If you're mentally, physically and spiritually in a great place, you can achieve anything you want. That't where I'm at, and that's why I think I'm pretty successful right now."
