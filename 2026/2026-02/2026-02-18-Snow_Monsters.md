# Snow Monsters
An astonishing natural feature draws visitors from around the world

While countless mountain ranges exist, Japan's Ou Mountains are home to the most famous striking figures known as juhyo, or snow monsters. Juhyo are formed when ice builds up on trees, forming a thick layer that makes the trees look like alien monsters. Specific conditions are required for juhyo to form, including strong, consistent wind in a single direction, heavy snowfall and the correct type of trees.

The Zao Mountains, one group of the Ou Mountains, are best known for these snow monsters and offer many ways to see them. Visitors can view the juhyo on foot, from a cable car or by skiing or snowboarding. There is even a nighttime light show, in which the monsters are illuminated with colorful light.

Since the formation of the snow monsters depends on weather patterns, visitors should plan their trip around the weather, if possible. The fierce storms that form the juhyo may make travel difficult, but periods of warm weather result in the snow melting and sliding off the trees. Nevertheless, the snow monsters are an amazing sight and an instance of the strange beauty that appears on our amazing planet.

### Note
Tykky, Finnish snow monsters similar to juhyo, can be found in Riisitunturi National Park in Finland.

The snow-monster season in Japan usually goes from December through March. The monsters are largest from the middle of February to the middle of March.
