# Be Media Smart
Understand the influence of advertising

Companies spend billions advertising to children and young teens. Though most don't have jobs or a steady income, Generation Alpha in the U.S. still managed to spend US$101 billion in 2024, indicating to advertisers that they are a worthwhile market. Young people have many years of purchasing power ahead of them, so if companies develop brand loyalty early, they'll have customers for life. And though young people's ready cash is limited, they possess what advertisers call pester power - the ability to persuade their parents to buy them things. With no living expenses to pay, children are easily tempted into purchasing overpriced products. Their still-developing brains also make them easy targets for advertisers as they may be too naive to recognize false claims made in ads.

As children's use of internet-connected devices increases - more than half of U.S. children own a smartphone by age 11 - so does the reach of advertising. Ads are incorporated into video games, TikToks, movies and even school materials. The Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health reported that social media platforms made almost US$11 billion in ads from viewers under the age of 18 in 2022.

Advertising has its uses. It informs consumers about innovative products and encourages business competition. However, it can have a negative impact on consumers - especially children and teens.

Advertisers use bright colors, prizes, humor, music, characters and celebrity endorsements to suggest that a product brings happiness or popularity. For children and youth, who have lower impulse control, these advertisements have a powerful effect. They can lead to unhealthy choices like smoking, drinking or eating junk food. Ads can also harm one's self-image by promoting beauty standards that are not realistic and encouraging materialism. While kids are more vulnerable, by no means are adults immune. Anyone can be influenced by ads. 

As advertising increases, so does the need for government intervention. Ads are already restricted on kid's channels, and false claims are illegal. As of January 2025, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also requires parents' consent before companies can use children's data to tailor ads.

Though regulations can help protect you from some of advertising's negative influences, they aren't enough. It's important to understand how ads work to gain greater control over your buying habits. Use critical thinking: What does the ad promise? Is it too good to be true? Can the source be trusted? Is this product a want or a need? Finally, limit your screen time to decrease your exposure to advertising and reduce impulse buying. While advertising is an unavoidable part of modern life, It doesn't have to dictate your choices or control your lifestyle.
### note
Advertising targets children through digital platforms, influencing spending, brand loyalty and self-image. While regulations exist, critical thinking and limited screen time help reduce harmful effects.

De Beers diamond company had a problem: too many diamonds. So they put out an ad in 1948 that stated "A Diamond is Forever," convincing men that only diamond rings were suitable as engagement rings because diamonds represent a love that lasts. It was a massive success! 

Marketing is no longer about the stuff that you make but about the stories you tell. - Seth Godin, Advertising Legend
