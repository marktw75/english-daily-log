# The Power of Compliments

Compliments may seem small, but they can have a huge effect on one's mental health. Not only the receive but also the giver benefits. Compliments can improve our mood, encourage further kind actions and strengthen the bonds between people.

One inspiring example comes from Ethan Wargo, age 9, who set up a stand in his neighborhood. Instead of hoping to earn some pocket change with a lemonade stand, Ethan wanted to lift people's spirits. As people approached his stand, he engaged in small talk with them. Then he offered a sincere compliment that he carefully chose to reflect something real about the person. This ensured that the compliment didn't feel shallow or forced. Soon dozens of people began visiting the stand to hear a kind word. "It makes people feel good; it also makes me feel good," Ethan explained.

Compliments remind us of our strengths and value. Besides lifting our spirits, they build confidence and remind us that we are all connected. While March 1 is World Compliment Day, we don't need a special day to share kind words. Give one today!
